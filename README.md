# Apply Filter to BMP
This program only runs on a Linux OS because it uses pthread.h which is a Linux based threading library. The program takes 2 parameters, a bmp image file, and a filter type. The program reads the bitmap image in binary and applies a filter to each pixel. The two filter options are a **blur** filter and a **swiss cheese** filter

Sample output:
